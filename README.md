🎓 Laptop Lifeline: Visualizing Student Device Usage Patterns

I’m excited to share my Power BI dashboard project completed as part of my Value-Added Course (VAC) – First Assessment Task. Titled “Laptop Lifeline: Visualize Device Usage Patterns,” this project was designed, developed, and presented individually during the scheduled course hours.

📘 Project Overview:
This project explores how students use digital devices like laptops, mobiles, and tablets for study, entertainment, and communication. The goal was to identify patterns in usage behavior, evaluate how these patterns impact focus, sleep, and academic performance, and present the insights in an interactive Power BI dashboard.

📘 Dataset Overview:
A dataset of 100 students was analyzed to examine:
📱 Device preference and brand
⏰ Usage time (morning, evening, night) and usage location (home, classroom, library, hostel)
🎓 Balance between study and entertainment purposes
📲 Most used applications and internet usage mode (WiFi vs Mobile Data)
💤 Sleep disruption based on device type used

📈 Charts Used in the Dashboard:
📊 Pie Chart – Device type distribution (Laptop, Mobile, Tablet)
📈 Line Chart – Usage trends by time of day
📊 Clustered Bar Chart – Comparison of study vs entertainment hours by purpose
📊 Stacked Bar Chart – Device usage across different locations
📋 Matrix Table – Sleep impact categorized by device type
📊 Bar Chart (Horizontal) – Most used applications like Zoom, YouTube by device type
📊 Bar Chart – Device brand preferences(Apple, Samsung, HP, Others)
🍩 Doughnut Chart – Preferred internet usage mode (WiFi vs Mobile)
🕒 Gauge Chart – Average daily usage of devices (5.49 hours)
🔢 KPI Cards – Key performance indicators:
Total Student Count
Average Study Hours
Average Entertainment Hours
🎛️ Slicers (Interactive Filters) – Based on Operating System and Department

🔍 Key Insights:
📱 Mobile (37%) and 💻 Laptop (36%) are almost equally preferred, while Tablet usage is lower (27%)
🌃 Most device activity occurs at night and evening, especially for entertainment
🎓 Students using devices for both study & entertainment had the highest average usage
🏠 Home is the top location for device use, followed by classroom and library
💤 Mobile usage is more likely to impact sleep negatively
📶 56% prefer WiFi over mobile data

✅ Conclusion:
This project offered a clear view into how modern students engage with digital devices, balancing academic and personal use. It strengthened my ability to:
1.Clean and transform data using Power Query
2.Create insightful, interactive dashboards using Power BI
